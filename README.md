# Problem Statement:
The New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) is in charge of overseeing the safety and integrity of construction and building operations throughout the city. However, the number and types of safety infractions registered by the agency varied significantly across locations, equipment, and building types. The goal of this research is to extract insights from the DOB Safety Violations dataset by recognizing trends in violation occurrences, determining their categories, and predicting future violations with machine learning algorithms. The ultimate goal is to make recommendations that can help the DOB enhance safety compliance and avoid future infractions.

# About Dataset:
This data set includes violations issued on devices through the New York City Department of Buildings' DOB NOW: Safety Violations module. The data is collected because the Department of Buildings tracks violation issuance and related information. This data includes items such as violations number, violations type, violation issuance data, and BIN.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a vital part of this research that aims to discover insights and trends in the DOB Safety Violations dataset. The dataset initially required extensive cleaning, which included removing duplicates, lowering columns with a high number of missing values, and removing rows with missing data. These pretreatment methods ensured that the analysis was carried out on a stable and consistent dataset.

# Recommendations:
Based on the information gained by EDA and prediction models:
# Targeted Inspections:
Focus greater resources on checking areas and buildings with a high frequency of previous infractions. Predictive models can help to prioritize these examinations.
Enhanced Training Programs: For building managers and contractors in high-violation areas, providing more rigorous training on safety standards and compliance may prevent future violations.
# Policy Changes:
Consider changing regulations or implementing harsher enforcement procedures in places where certain types of infractions are common, as identified by our analysis.
Data-Driven Decision Making: The DOB should continue to use machine learning algorithms to anticipate and prevent safety infractions proactively, resulting in better building practices throughout the city.

# Conclusion:
The analysis of DOB safety infractions has provided useful insights into the trends and factors that influence building safety compliance in New York City. We were able to forecast violations with reasonable accuracy using machine learning models, implying that predictive analytics can play an important role in enhancing building safety. Moving forward, the DOB can use these data-driven ways to maximize its resources, improve safety standards, and ultimately reduce the number of safety infractions in the city.
